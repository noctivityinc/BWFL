<%= "Hi #{@user.name}," %>

Thanks for coming over and (hopefully) wishing Lisa happy birthday!  If you 
didnt' have time to do it, please make sure you come back by March 15th 
and record something for her.  

All you need to do is click on this link to return:

<%= user_url(@user) %>

or you can just come back to the site and reenter your name and email address.

Of course if you have a fancy phone with a camera (I believe ya call them iPhones) you can 
record a mesage with that and email it to josh@birthdaywishesforlisa.com as well.


If you know anyone else who knows Lisa, PLEASE send them a note asking them to 
come to the site and record a message for her.


Thank You!!


Josh, Emma and Ellie :)
