Hi,

Lisa's 40th bday is rapidly approaching (don't tell her I told you that, she would be pissed) 
and to surprise her we are trying to record quick 20 second video bday wishes that we are 
going to show her on her birthday.

<%= @user.name %> asked me to send you a note to visit the site to record a bday wish for her.

All you have to do is either visit http://www.birthdaywishesforlisa.com or record a quick 
15-20 second fun bday wish for Lisa on your phone and email it to josh@birthdaywishesforlisa.com.



Thank You!!


Josh, Emma and Ellie (Lippiner)
