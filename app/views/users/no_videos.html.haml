	%p
		Since you apparently know Lisa then you should (hopefully) have something 
		fun to wish for her on her 40th b-day.  She didn't want a big surprise party, 
		so instead I'm hoping to get everyone who has touched her life to "surprise" 
		her with a quick message.

	%p
		Make it fun, moving, heartwarming, tasteful, tasteless, nostalgic, whatever.  
		Tell a story, a joke.  Whatever.  

	%p
		Don't just say "Happy Birthday."  Boring!
		Make it special and make it between you and her.

	- if !unsupported
		%h2 Option 1 - This Site
		%p
			If you have a webcam on this computer, simply click NEXT below and you will 
			see a little box asking you to click to "Start Recording."  Click that, accept 
			the prompt that appears and record away.  After that you can even see what others
			had to say :)
	- else
		%h2 Option 1 - Use a different browswer (IE Sucks)
		%p
			Unfortunately you are using Internet Explorer to view this site.  IE is terrible and 
			doesn't let you do a lot of things, such as recording video.  So use Chrome, Safari or 
			Firefox or simply use Option 2 below but you can't go further with IE right now.  Sorry. 
	 
	%h2 Option 2 - Use Your Phone
	%p
		If you have an iPhone or fancy phone with a camera, feel free to just record your 
		message that way and email it to
		= mail_to "josh@birthdaywishesforlisa.com"

	%h2 Deadline
	%p
		Whichever way you pick, please just do it by <b>March 15th, 2012!</b>  And keep it secret :)
